## Context

The single build story for epic `0613-dnv`. Authors the new pmos-toolkit `/consequences` skill against the design contract `docs/pmos/features/2026-06-13_consequences-skill/02_design.html` and the standing skill-authoring criteria (`feature-sdlc/reference/skill-patterns.md §A–§L`, repo `CLAUDE.md` conventions). One `/execute` run = one PR.

**Leanness is a first-class constraint (D6):** the skill body must stay as simple and short as `/grill`'s (~184 lines). The design doc holds the rationale; the SKILL.md describes the method at a high level and relies on model intelligence to simulate — no transcribed algorithm, scoring formula, or enumerated procedure.

## Acceptance Criteria

(Inherited verbatim from epic `0613-dnv` — they are the change-set for this story.)

- [ ] AC1 — A registered, eval-passing `/consequences` skill exists at `plugins/pmos-toolkit/skills/consequences/SKILL.md` (passes `skill-eval.md`, floor 43/47; frontmatter `name: consequences` matches dir; argument-hint flags all handled in the body).
- [ ] AC2 — **Intake** accepts a file path, a pipeline-doc stem (resolved via `_shared/resolve-input.md`), or inline text/URL (ask-for-paste fallback); summarizes the proposal in 3–5 bullets and confirms the read before simulating.
- [ ] AC3 — **Simulation** (Futures Wheel + "and then what?"): first-order effects across the adapted-STEEP product lens set (Users, Business, Team/Org, Technical, Market, Ethics/Risk), recursively expanded to second- and third-order, capped by `--orders` (default 3) with breadth by `--depth` (brief/standard/deep, same semantics as `/grill`); convergent chains merged. Described at a high level — model-driven, not a prescribed algorithm (D6).
- [ ] AC4 — **Scoring**: every notable effect tagged likelihood (H/M/L) × impact (H/M/L) × desirability (good/bad/mixed); interrogation ordered by leverage (high-impact + uncertain/negative first) but surfaces every notable effect, not a filtered top-N (D1). Qualitative tags only — no arithmetic.
- [ ] AC5 — **Consequence map** presented (chat + saved report) BEFORE interrogation, as a scored nested 1st→2nd→3rd-order tree.
- [ ] AC6 — **Grill loop**: one `AskUserQuestion` per notable effect (leverage-ordered), each tying the ripple to a refinement (mitigate / accept / design-around / invalidate) with a recommended answer + alternatives + Elaborate + Skip; branches on the answer (mitigation can spawn a new chain; a surprise can insert a missed effect); code-answerable questions resolved by grep/read, not asked; deep mode has no question budget (same stop rules as `/grill`).
- [ ] AC7 — **Report** (optional save, `--save`/`--no-save` + `output_format`): single self-contained HTML — scored consequence tree + interrogation transcript + refinements/residual-risks — via `_shared/html-authoring/` (inline-comments overlay, `pmos:skill` meta, asset prefix, cache-bust, kebab heading ids, sections.json, index regen). **Tree-only, no SVG diagram** (D2).
- [ ] AC8 — **Standalone sibling** (D3): own interrogation loop citing `/grill` as prior art; NO `_shared/` substrate extraction; no `/grill` edits.
- [ ] AC9 — **Conventions**: `--non-interactive` per the W14 contract (canonical inline block byte-identical; per-consequence questions `defer-only`); §H–§L satisfied; §L dispatch documented (inline default + optional code-explore helper); `--depth`/`--orders`/`--save`/`--format`/`--non-interactive` in argument-hint and handled.
- [ ] AC10 — **Lean body** (D6): SKILL.md comparable in length/simplicity to `/grill`'s (~184 lines); high-level method description relying on model intelligence, not a transcribed step-by-step recipe/formula. Over-specification fails this AC.
- [ ] AC11 — Release prerequisites (version bump, changelog row, README/manifest sync, learnings header) listed under the spec's `## Release prerequisites` only, NOT as `/execute` wave tasks (skill-mode scope rule).

## Notes

Plan + `tasks.yaml` authored at define time (this loop). Build happens in Loop 2 via `/feature-sdlc build --story 0613-fzy` (or `--next`).
