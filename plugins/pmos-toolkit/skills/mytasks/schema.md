# /mytasks Item Schema

> Binds the shared tracker contract in [`../_shared/tracker-crudl.md`](../_shared/tracker-crudl.md). This file declares mytasks's **bindings** (fields, enums, index-view shape, archive root); the shared contract governs the **invariants** (id/slug rules, `created`/`updated`/`schema_version`, derived-on-read index view §5 INV-1/2/3, archive convention).

Every task is a markdown file at `~/.pmos/tasks/items/{id}-{slug}.md`.

## Filename

Numeric-id store — `id`/`slug` rules per `../_shared/tracker-crudl.md` §2. Binding: a single per-skill `id` counter (the store is global to the user, not per-repo).

> **`schema_version`** is `3` as of the goal-attachment extension (story 260705-ebm). Files written before this (`schema_version: 2`, `1`, or the key absent) stay valid. Two one-shot load-time normalizations run in `lib.js loadAllItems`, key-presence-only and idempotent, never rewriting ids or other fields: `migrateWorkstreamKey` renames a `1`-era `workstream:` → `project:`, and `normalizeTaskSchema` adds the bare `goal:`/`milestone:` keys and stamps `schema_version: 3` on any `<3` file. Both are no-ops once applied. (New tasks are born at `3` with bare attachment keys, so the pass never rewrites a fresh task out from under a client's optimistic-concurrency version token.)

### Enum values (the skill MUST validate against these and never invent new ones)

| Field | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| `type` | `execution`, `follow-up`, `reminder`, `idea`, `read`, `call` |
| `importance` | `leverage`, `neutral`, `overhead` |
| `status` | `pending`, `in-progress`, `waiting`, `completed`, `dropped` |
| `checkin` | `daily`, `weekly`, `biweekly`, `monthly`, `none` |

`type`, `importance`, `status`, and `checkin` are closed enums. `project`, `parent`, `order`, `recur`, `people`, `labels`, and `links` are NOT enums — they are free / id / integer / list values constrained only by the rules below.

### Project, subtask, order, recurrence (the project/subtask extension)

| Field | Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `project` | optional free string (a project slug) | Todoist-style container. **Replaces** the old `workstream` field. **User-curated and fully manual** — never auto-inferred from repo context (see `inference-heuristics.md` "What is NEVER inferred"). A task with no `project` value belongs to **Inbox**. |
| `goal` | goal id \| `none` \| empty | Attachment to a [goal](#mytasks-goal-schema). Empty ⇒ **inherit** the goal its `project` is attached to (if any). A goal id ⇒ **direct** link (wins over inherit). `none` ⇒ **explicit detach** (wins over inherit — the task counts toward no goal even if its project is attached). |
| `milestone` | milestone ref (`m<N>`) \| empty | Optional milestone within the attached goal. Honored **only when `goal` is set directly** — an inherited (project-level) goal attaches at goal level, never milestone. |
| `parent` | optional task id | When set, this task is a **subtask** — a full child task file (all fields available) whose `parent:` points at another task's id. |
| `order` | optional integer | Manual sort position within a project. Smart date-views ignore `order:` (they sort by date); it only governs ordering inside a single project/list. |
| `recur` | optional recurrence rule | Non-empty ⇒ the task recurs (see "Recurrence" below). Empty/absent ⇒ one-shot. |

**Effective-goal resolution (design §3.2, INV-4/INV-5).** A task's effective goal is a single pure function (`lib.js effectiveGoal(task, projectGoals)`) so a task counts toward a goal **at most once** (direct + inherited can never double-count): `goal == 'none'` → none (detach wins) · a set `goal` id → that goal (direct wins) · else the goal its `project` is attached to → inherited · else none. `effectiveMilestone(task)` is the task's `milestone` only when `goal` is set directly, else none. The `project → goal` map is built from goals' `attached_projects` lists (below), **not** from `registry.json`.

**Subtask semantics.** A subtask is an ordinary task file with `parent:` set; it carries its own `status`, `due`, `people`, `importance`, `recur`, etc. **Completing a parent does NOT auto-complete its children** — each child's status is independent. Nesting (indenting children under a parent) is a **view-layer** concern; the stored files stay flat.

**Recurrence (`recur:`).** Closed phrase set (case-insensitive):

| Rule | Advance `due`/`start` by |
|---|---|
| `daily` | +1 day |
| `weekly` | +7 days |
| `biweekly` | +14 days |
| `monthly` | +1 calendar month, clamped to the last day of the target month (e.g. Jan 31 → Feb 28; Aug 31 → Sep 30) — **reuses the existing check-in `monthly` clamp**, SKILL.md `#checkin` |
| `every <N> days` | +N days |
| `every <N> weeks` | +(7×N) days |
| `every <N> months` | +N calendar months, same last-day clamp as `monthly` |
| `every <weekday>` (e.g. `every monday`) | next occurrence of that weekday, exclusive of the anchor date (same rule as the `inference-heuristics.md` bare-weekday parse) |

Recurrence uses the **spawn-new-instance** model (design D8): on `complete` of a task whose `recur:` is non-empty, the task is marked `completed` and a **brand-new task** is minted — a fresh `<YYMMDD>-<rand3>` id, the same fields (including `recur:` and `parent:`), with `due`/`start` advanced by the rule above; the completion is logged to the old task's `## Check-ins`/`## Notes`. (The `complete`-time spawn mechanics land with the CLI/web layer in the sibling stories; this file is the contract they implement.)

### Defaults on quick-capture (`/mytasks <bare text>`)

- `schema_version: 3` (shared §3; `2`/`1`/absent still valid, normalized on read)
- `status: pending`
- `importance: neutral`
- `type:` per inference (see `inference-heuristics.md`); fallback `execution`
- `created`, `updated`: today
- `project:` **absent** by default (lands in Inbox) — `project` is manual, never inferred
- `goal:`, `milestone:`, `parent:`, `order:`, `recur:` — bare keys by default (never auto-set at capture; attachment is explicit via `/mytasks attach`)
- `people:` from `@handle` tokens (resolved via `/people find`); unresolved tokens flagged in capture report
- `due:` from natural-language date parse if present, else empty
- All other optional fields: written as bare keys with no value (e.g., `start:`, `project:`, `goal:`, `milestone:`, `parent:`, `order:`, `recur:`), never omitted — the file shape stays consistent (this is mytasks's §4 empty-optional binding)

### Defaults on rich-capture (`/mytasks add`)

All fields prompted via `_shared/interactive-prompts.md`. Each prompt has a sensible default; `<enter>` accepts.

## Body

Entirely freeform. The skill recognizes (but does not require) two conventional H2 sections:

```markdown
## Notes
Free-form. User-written.

## Check-ins
- 2026-04-25: synced with Sarah, on track   # auto-managed by /mytasks checkin
```

Tasks captured quickly typically have no body. The `## Check-ins` section is created by `/mytasks checkin <id>` if absent.

## Index view format

The bare-`/mytasks` at-a-glance index is a **view derived on read** from `~/.pmos/tasks/items/*.md` (`lib.js renderIndex`) — there is **no committed `INDEX.md`** and no writer, per `../_shared/tracker-crudl.md` §5 (INV-1/2/3: never persisted; empty cells, never `null`; computed fresh per read, so no `Last regenerated:` line). Binding (grouping/sort/columns):

```markdown
# My Tasks

## leverage
| id | type | status | due | next_checkin | title | project | parent |
|----|------|--------|-----|--------------|-------|---------|--------|
| 260613-a3f | execution | in-progress | 2026-05-12 |  | Draft Q3 OKRs for Platform team | platform-q3 |  |

|----|------|--------|-----|--------------|-------|---------|--------|

```

Items grouped by `importance` (`leverage`, `neutral`, `overhead`). Within each group, sorted by `due` asc (no-due last) → `updated` desc. A bucket with zero items still gets its `## {bucket}` header and column row (never omit the bucket). Status-based exclusion (mytasks binding): `completed` and `dropped` items are NOT in the index view (cell-rendering and archived-exclusion per shared §5).

**`project` column** replaces the former `workstream` column. **Subtasks stay flat in the index view** (design §9 resolution): a subtask is rendered as an ordinary row in its importance bucket, with its `parent:` id shown in the `parent` column — the index view is not nested. Visual nesting (children indented under a parent) is a view-layer concern handled by the readers (terminal `show`/`list` and the web UI), never baked into the derived index view. An empty `parent` cell means a top-level task.

## Archive

mytasks archives, per `../_shared/tracker-crudl.md` §6. Binding: archive root `~/.pmos/tasks/archive/`, so tasks land at `~/.pmos/tasks/archive/YYYY-QN/{id}-{slug}.md` (full content preserved, mirrors `items/`, never in `INDEX.md`).

## Projects/labels registry (`registry.json`)

`~/.pmos/tasks/registry.json` is an **optional, add-only visibility cache** for the web sidebar — created on first write, never required to exist. Shape:

```json
{ "projects": ["marketing-plan"], "labels": ["q3"] }
```

Both lists hold slug-normalized, deduped, sorted entries. Its sole purpose is to let an **empty, freshly-created** project or label appear in the web sidebar before any task uses it (the web `POST /api/projects` / `POST /api/labels` add here). It is **strictly additive**:

- The task markdown files remain the source of truth for which projects/labels actually exist. `GET /api/meta` returns the **union** of registry entries and the values derived by scanning task frontmatter, so a registry entry only ever *adds* a name — it never hides or overrides a task-derived one, and removing the last task in a registry-listed project does not drop the project from the sidebar.
- The terminal verbs are **registry-agnostic** (D5): `/mytasks` CLI never reads or writes `registry.json` and derives projects/labels purely from task files. Deleting `registry.json` loses only the empty-container hints; no task data is affected.

It is an optional, additive convenience cache (empty-container hints only), not a record of truth — distinct from the at-a-glance index view, which is never persisted and is always derived on read (§5 INV-1).

# /mytasks Goal Schema

> Also binds [`../_shared/tracker-crudl.md`](../_shared/tracker-crudl.md). **Goals are a second tracker collection** alongside `items/` — the same id/slug rules (§2), the same `created`/`updated`/`schema_version` (§3), the same move-not-delete archive (§6). The one structural addition is an **embedded `milestones:` frontmatter list**, described below. Grounds in feature `02_design.html` §2 (INV-1/INV-2/INV-3, decisions D2/D6).

Every goal is a markdown file at `~/.pmos/tasks/goals/{id}-{slug}.md` — a sibling directory to `items/`, not a task type. Goals and tasks never share a file; a task *references* a goal by id in later stories (out of scope here).

## Goal filename

Numeric-id store — `id`/`slug` per `../_shared/tracker-crudl.md` §2 (`<YYMMDD>-<rand3>`, minted by `lib.js mintId` from the same Crockford-base32 alphabet as tasks). The `goals/` directory is the collection namespace; ids are drawn from the shared per-user space.

## Goal frontmatter

```yaml
---
schema_version: 1
id: 260705-k2p
title: Ship the goals & milestones feature
type: dated                        # enum {dated, open-ended}
status: active                     # enum {active, achieved, dropped}
cadence: weekly                    # enum {daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly} — reuses the check-in cadence set
target: 2026-09-30                 # ISO date; present for `dated`, a bare key for `open-ended`

attached_projects: [platform-q3]   # project slugs attached to this goal (D8) — the project→goal map's source of truth; `[]` when none
milestones:                        # embedded list; the machine source of truth (INV-1)
  - ref: m1                        # stable, never reused after deletion (INV-2)

    met_date:                      # ISO date, set when met -> true
  - ref: m2

```

### Goal enum values (the skill MUST validate against these and never invent new ones)

| Field | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| `type` | `dated`, `open-ended` |
| `status` | `active`, `achieved`, `dropped` |
| `cadence` | `daily`, `weekly`, `biweekly`, `monthly` |

`type`, `status`, and `cadence` are closed enums (`validateGoal` rejects any other value — AC3/§2.2). `target` is required-ish for a `dated` goal (an ISO date) and **must be empty** for an `open-ended` goal; a non-ISO `target`, or a `target` on an open-ended goal, is a validation error.

### Milestones (`milestones:` — the embedded list)

Each entry is `{ref, description, due, met, met_date}`:

| Field | Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ref` | `m<N>` | Stable handle, unique within the goal. Minted by `nextMilestoneRef` off the goal's `milestone_seq` counter, which **only ever increases** — so a dropped ref's number is **never handed out again** (INV-2), even when the highest-numbered milestone is the one dropped. |
| `description` | free string | What the milestone is. |
| `due` | ISO date or bare | Target date; optional. |
| `met` | boolean | `true` once reached. |
| `met_date` | ISO date or bare | Set when `met` flips to `true`. |

**INV-1 — frontmatter is truth, the body mirrors it.** The `milestones:` frontmatter list is the sole machine-read source. The `## Milestones` body block is a **human mirror regenerated from the frontmatter on every write** (`regenerateMilestonesBody`) — it is never parsed back for computation, so a hand-edit to the body block is overwritten on the next verb, not honored.

**`attached_projects` — the project→goal map lives here (D8).** Each goal owns the list of project slugs attached to it. `lib.js buildProjectGoals(goals)` scans these lists into the in-memory `{slug → goalId}` map the resolver uses; `registry.json` is **never** read or written for attachments (it stays the optional, deletable visibility cache it is documented to be). A single project attached to **two** goals is a validation error — a project maps to at most one goal.

## Goal body

```markdown
## Milestones
- [ ] m1 — Data model + CRUD landed (due 2026-07-20)
- [x] m2 — Pace signals surfaced (due 2026-08-15) — met 2026-08-14

## Notes
Free-form. User-written. Preserved verbatim across milestone-mirror regeneration.
```

The `## Milestones` block is machine-owned (regenerated — INV-1); every other section (e.g. `## Notes`) is preserved verbatim.

## Goal archive

Goals archive per `../_shared/tracker-crudl.md` §6, **sharing the tasks archive root**: an `achieved` or `dropped` goal moves (not deleted) to `~/.pmos/tasks/archive/YYYY-QN/{id}-{slug}.md` and leaves every active surface (INV-3). `loadAllGoals` scans only the live `goals/` directory, so an archived goal is absent from lists and lookups.
